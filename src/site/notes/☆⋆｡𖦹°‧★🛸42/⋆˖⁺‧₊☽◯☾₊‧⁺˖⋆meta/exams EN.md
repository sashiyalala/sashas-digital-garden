- 📁`~/docs/` — instructions for exams. There're 2 type of files, both with many versions, each translated into a different language
	- 📄`README.md` files, with short instructions
	- 📄 (can't remember) with the long instructions. This is what I'm trying to write down here
- 📁`~/rendu/` — the folder/repository where you work and will be used to grade you
- 📁`~/subjects/` — the folder that gets populated with your exercise prompts

⚠ ❗❗❗ FIRST OF ALL, open your terminal and run 
```bash
$ anuro
```
this command opens a command line program that will be the exam process
follow all the instructions and ❗❗**get to the "examshell" in the first 10min of the exam** ❗❗

👀 try to read the `README` and/or the instructions under `~/docs` to understand the exam process & how `anuro` works, what to do if it breaks, frequent questions, etc.

The exam has 10 levels and the mark is 0-100.
- each level counts for a specific amount of points (so far I've only seen them count 10?)
- every new level, a new exercise is and the prompt is generated in `~/subjects/`
