# plan?
even tho u can start reading and doing work, don't press the "start" button on the projects yet

>[!idea] start reading on the born2beroot but focus on the C projects first


>[!tip] from tutors
> start with ft_printf or gnl as the b2br is quicker


>[!tip] (from many people)
> don't do the printf bonus, too hard for what it is
