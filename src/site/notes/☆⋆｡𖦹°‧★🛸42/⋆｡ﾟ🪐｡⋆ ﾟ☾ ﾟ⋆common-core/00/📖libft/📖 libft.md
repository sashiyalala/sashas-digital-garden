# ToDo
## progress
- [x] learn makefile
- [x] focus on main part, not bonus
- [x] learn how to compile a library
- [ ] ? make notes for all generic projects, small norminette summary
	- [ ] make cmts on makefile from Docs in *CLARTE*
- [x] check if `fd < 0` in all writing functions!! 
	actually. it shouldn't matter, right? cuz I'm just passing the chars to the same `write` function anyways, so if that doesn't break anything, I don't mind checking if `fd<0`.
	Yes, I can save a function call, but who cares when it's just to a fn that calls write
- [x] [[☆⋆｡𖦹°‧★🛸42/⋆｡ﾟ🪐｡⋆ ﾟ☾ ﾟ⋆common-core/00/📖libft/bonus libft\|bonus libft]]
- [ ] remove "s" from "ac rcs" in makefile just in case
- [ ] compare with dario's repo (link on wpp)
- [ ] add mains to all methods, specially the *bonus* ones
- [x] move all used *includes* to the header
>[!danger] NORM
