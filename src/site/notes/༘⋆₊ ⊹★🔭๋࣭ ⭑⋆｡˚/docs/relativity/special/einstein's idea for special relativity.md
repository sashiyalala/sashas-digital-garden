in addition to the [[à¼˜â‹†â‚Š âŠ¹â˜…ðŸ”­à¹‹à£­ â­‘â‹†ï½¡Ëš/docs/relativity/relativity principle\|relativity principle]] being a law of physics, he also added the [[à¼˜â‹†â‚Š âŠ¹â˜…ðŸ”­à¹‹à£­ â­‘â‹†ï½¡Ëš/docs/relativity/special/principle of light constancy\|principle of light constancy]] as a **law of physics**

observe how, if you indeed assume that both of these are a law of physics, it is immediate that
