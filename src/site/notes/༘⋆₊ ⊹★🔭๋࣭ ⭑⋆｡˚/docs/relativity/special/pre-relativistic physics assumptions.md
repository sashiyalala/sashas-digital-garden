>[!abstract] assumption
> there is no ambiguity in measuring time between [[à¼˜â‹†â‚Š âŠ¹â˜…ðŸ”­à¹‹à£­ â­‘â‹†ï½¡Ëš/docs/classical-mechanics/reference frame\|R.F.]]'s

i.e., any 2+ people representing a different [[à¼˜â‹†â‚Š âŠ¹â˜…ðŸ”­à¹‹à£­ â­‘â‹†ï½¡Ëš/docs/classical-mechanics/reference frame\|R.F.]] each, can measure time with a clock each.
1. they can synchronize the clocks
2. the clocks stay synchronized as they move
