>[!definition] reference frame
>  the combination of:
>  - a set of *spatial* coordinates $x, y, z$
>  - a *time* coordinate $t$
>  - a point in space as the *origin*
>  - an agreement of the orientation on each axis

>[!notation] R.F.'s & people
> per L. Susskind's lectures/books, it will be common to talk about different **reference frames** and **subjects/people** interchangeably, as if a person is a R.F.'s origin

this definition comes from [[classical mechanics\|classical mechanics]]

>[!tip] focus on 1 spatial dimension to understand
> things are easier to visualize in 2 dimensions rather than 4. therefore, in order to explain some concepts/examples, one may usually focus on just a single spatial coordinate, say, $x$

# operations on reference frames
you can
- rotate a R.F., any angle
- translate a R.F., i.e. move the origin to another point relative to a R.F.
without losing the definition of distance to the origin between 2 R.F.s
